# KnotPull - a simplifier for 3D structures

KnotPull reduces a user provided 3D structure, to simplify it,
while preserving the topology of the chain. It has been successfully
used for knot detection in proteins and chromatine chains.

It can return either a final, simplified structure, or a .pdb formatted
trajectory of consecutive simplifications performed.
